**Brandon Lerner** is a Engineering Manager from [Scarsdale](https://www.scarsdale.com/), New York. After graduating from The College of Computer and Information Science from Northeastern University, he worked at PayPal from 2012 - 2020.

He started my journey in 2012 as a mobile engineer in the downtown Boston office working on the [PayPal Here](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/credit-card-reader) and [PayPal Business](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/mobile-apps/business-app) apps. Eventually in 2016 he found myself moving back home to New York where I transferred into the Venmo organization working on all of their amazing products.

As a hobby, Brandon hosts[ clamming experiences](https://www.airbnb.com/experiences/977804) in East Hampton, NY during the summers.
